AFH provide ongoing product knowledge refresher training, So, if something doesn't 'click' the first time around, you may well understand it much better after having some hands on experience in your new role & sitting in the refresher training session again. - Knowing that through my work I'm able to assist other people, whether that's clients, co-workers, the advisers, supervisors or management; providing information needed and answering questions - to me that is the one of the biggest pros, job satisfaction. - Knowing that management trust me to use my own initiative to create & implement new strategies whilst working on large projects. - There are great possibilities of advancing your career and moving within the business. - Management acknowledging your efforts and going out of their way to thank you when you have worked hard. - Treated with respect and kindness & feel valued as an employee.  - Fast-paced environment, never a dull moment and the time at work flies by! - Great benefits package. - Supportive and friendly co-workers. - Lovely office building to work in. - The list of pros could go on & on... but I'd be here all day.
